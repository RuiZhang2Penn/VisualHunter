I learned so much in this project, a twitch+ recommendation system, a Personalized Twitch Resources Recommendation

● Built a full-stack web application for user to search Twitch resources (stream/video/clip) and get recommendations

● Designed a web page with rich+ user friendly experience using React and Ant Design

● Implemented RESTful APIs using Java Servlets, retrieved real Twitch resources using Twitch API, used MySQL to store real data and deployed it to Amazon RDS, 

● Supported login/logout and favorite collection

● Explored multiple recommendation algorithms and extracted game information from Twitch resources to implement a content-based algorithm, deployed the service to AWS EC2 for better stability
